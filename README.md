### Data visualisation and Shiny element embedded in R Markdown.

The purpose of this script is to automate:
Data wrangling, data visualisation and publishing a report which can be send via email to intended users on a single click.

To achieve this we need to enable OAUTH for the email to send the reports.

I have setup a gmail account and used the GMAIL API to send reports via email. One click distribution is a shiny library feature.

Dataset "World Happiness Index" is taken from Kaggle, which details various parameters and world ranking of the countries. Visualisations are made for this report.
