 Topic - Electric car sales in Norway.

 For this module we were required to build a data warehouse, automate it and answer business queries

SSIS and SSAS was performed in visual studio along with SSMS for executing SQL queries and to create database, tables.

ETL consisted of taking raw data and creating dimensions and fact tables from it.

Data sets were to be self procured. Data for one of the source is collected using API, another source of data is collection of tweets based on few keywords (tweets collected using AWS EC2 instance). Other data source was Statista

Business queries were visualised in Tableau.
