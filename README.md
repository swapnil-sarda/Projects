# Projects

### [Analysis of air quality index and prediction of PM2.5 pollutant level](https://github.com/swapnil-sarda/projects/tree/Machine-learning)

Tools used:	R, Python, Excel

Description: 
Researched air quality index for eight Tier-1 and Tier-2 Indian cities. Predicted the level of PM2.5 pollutants in the air for a period of seven days. Data mining method LSTM is used for this time series problem.
Data cleaning on the dataset to have consistent date format and handling of missing values using rolling mean is performed in R.
LSTM implementation including optimization of model is done using Python. Best performing model has RMSE 3.8 percent.


### [Data Warehouse](https://github.com/swapnil-sarda/projects/tree/Data-warehouse)

Tools used: R, MS SQL, Tableau, Visual Studio

Description:
Developed a data warehouse using Visual studio and Microsoft SQL Server. Flat files sources are automated to be downloaded from the internet at the time of deployment of data warehouse.
A database of tweets is generated using AWS EC2 instance and imported in R to perform sentiment analysis to find brand perception of with respect to electric cars offered by the respective brands.
BI queries visualised in Tableau.


### [Analytical CRM](https://github.com/swapnil-sarda/projects/tree/Analytical-CRM)

Tools used: Rstudio

Description:
Combined different datasets detailing college information.
Data preprocessing operations performed are, making college name variable consistent across different files and finding and removing outliers of number of students.
Implemented Chi square test by identifying two groups of variables which described college administration type and number of infrastructure facilities available.
Interpreted the outcome of the test by visualising the chi square matrix. Altered the dataset on this outcome.
Linear regression test performed to find correlation among variables.
From the output, deduced that there is positive correlation between number of students in a college and number of infrastructure facilities provided in rural areas in India.
Almost non existent correlation is found in Urban areas for the same set of variables as above.


### Data Visualisation

Tools used: R, Python, Tableau, PowerBI, Microsoft Excel, Infogram(Online tool to create infographs).

Description: 
Made a report on car sales in Ireland which involved using various tools like R, Python, Tableau, PowerBI, Microsoft excel to choose appropriate visualisations.

Created an inforgraphic on the topic of Income $100,000 in New York city, tax deductions, rent, daily expenditures and monthly and yearly savings.
