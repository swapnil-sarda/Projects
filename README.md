# Description

The aim of this project is to analyse data and find business value.

Dataset contains list of college and other details like Administration group, Location, Number of students, Various infrastructure facilities. 

A college has many facets which add to its value. One of the facet is the infrastructure faciliities available in the college. 

This project is implemented in R in two stages.

Chi square test is implemented to find correlation between categorical variables.

Linear regression is used to find how dependent highly correlated variables are with each other.

The result indicate that State owned colleges show positivie correlation between number of infrastructure facilties and number of student in the college compared to Privately owned colleges.

In Urban setting, the demand exists for colleges regardless of the administration style of college.

The difference comes in rural areas. State colleges are heavily subsidized and can afford to ask lower fees and still give higher number of infrastructure.

Whereas privately owned colleges in rural areas can highlight various educational courses offered to attract students who migrate from rural to urban locations.
