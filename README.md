## Project description

### Predicting air pollution for 7 days, for 8 cities of India using Long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.

### Data for this project is collected from National Air Quality Index website.

### [Data cleaning process done in R.](https://github.com/swapnil-sarda/projects/blob/Machine-learning/R%20Code)

### [Machine learning model implementation done in Python.](https://github.com/swapnil-sarda/projects/blob/Machine-learning/Python%20code)

The output is evaluated using the RMSE parameter. 

The  lowest RMSE (high accuracy) values were 3.6% for our best performing model in which the missing values were replaced with rolling mean.

While performing EDA on the dataset, we observed that average values of PM2.5 levels are higher in tier 2 cities when compared to tier 1 with the exception of Pune(a tier 2 city).
